# Cycle-Gans

# Description
Demonstration of a cycle GAN use case in autonomous driving. One major bottleneck is data collection under severe weather conditions, especially capturing night-time images. So the task is to generate night time equivalent images from daytime images, such that you have access to some outdoor images acquired at night and some at day, but no pairwise images are available.
